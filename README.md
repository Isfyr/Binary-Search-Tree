# Binary-Search-Tree
In this lab, you'll write a binary search tree: a tree in which each node has at most two children, and the items are stored in the tree in order. A node's left subtree stores only values that are less than the value at that node, and its right subtree stores only values that are greater. For simplicity, this tree can hold at most one instance of any value.

This tree is not self-balancing. There will be cases when it has poor (O(n)) performance.
